# IMAGECONVERSIONTOOL
Python based windows application to convert images to pdf format

To convert multiple images at once to pdf format, either select one from the computer storage or from a web url where an image is hosted.
When a url is entered, first the existence and authenticity is checked, if it passes the checks, it is added to the conversion stack. 
The converted images are saved in a pdf format in the Pictures section of the computer.
